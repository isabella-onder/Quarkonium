# Level 3 computing project: particle theory - quarkonium #

### Supervised by Dr Ivan Martinez Soler ###

Milestone project:

Plot the probability density function and find the energy E_nl of the n = 2, l = 1 state of Hydrogen.
Completed.

Tasks it can do:
- numerically solve Schrodinger equation for given energy and hence plot (normalised) probability density
- iterate over given range to find E_nl to 3 s.f. and cut off before divergence

Next goal: make it find ranges automatically, i.e. for given n and l do it all on its own
